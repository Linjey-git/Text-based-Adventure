d:Starting a conversation with them, you ask them about the map and where you are now. One of them says that you are in the forest of the Great South, and for information about the map, they ask for some kind of payment. Your eyes are confused and you start rummaging through your pockets and find nothing interesting except a couple of coins. The thugs say that's not enough, but you remember that there is a pendant with a stone around your neck that looks precious.

d:You pass this stone to the nearest bandit and he begins to grope it with animalistic interest. Then the stone goes to the leader of this group. He begins to look closely at your jewelry and you begin to read fear and then horror in his eyes. He wounds his ground and falls to his knees. His team looks at their leader in surprise, but after he throats them, they follow suit. You looked at them in surprise and started to open your mouth to pick them up, but they quickly took your card and started looking around. One of them served you a drink that smelled like honey. You drank it and felt a sweet taste with elements of alcohol and then realized that it was mead. You thank him for being so honest with you and after that the leader says that his name is Dominic and that he knows what kind of map it is and can tell you how to get there. Dominic tells you how to get there and gives you a sword, you say thank you and you say goodbye.

d:As you approach the small town, your eyes catch sight of a beautiful building with a stunning design that stands out from the rest of the structures around it. It seems to call out to you, drawing you in with its charm. You can't resist the temptation to take a closer look, so you head towards the building. As you get closer, you notice the intricate details and the care that went into its construction. You feel a sense of awe and wonder, wondering what kind of place it could be. After admiring the building for a while, you decide to explore more of the town. As you walk around, you hear the sound of metal clanging and sparks flying. You follow the noise until you come across a working blacksmith's shop. You watch as the blacksmith works, fascinated by the way they seem to wield the hammer with ease and precision. The forge is hot and the air is thick with the smell of metal and smoke. As you get closer, the blacksmith notices you and greets you with a friendly smile, you do the same.

d:The town you find yourself in has a rich and storied history that stretches back many years. Originally settled by a group of pioneers, the town began as a small collection of cabins in the wilderness. The pioneers were hardy and resourceful, and they built the town from scratch using only the materials they could find in the surrounding forest. Over time, the town grew and prospered, becoming an important center of trade and commerce in the region. Farmers from the surrounding countryside would come to town to sell their goods, and merchants from other towns would come to buy them. The town also became known for its skilled craftsmen, who would create beautiful objects of all kinds, from pottery to jewelry. Despite its success, the town was not immune to the challenges of life in the wild west. It was raided several times by bandits and outlaws, who would steal goods and cause destruction. But the townspeople were resilient, and they always managed to bounce back, rebuilding and repairing what had been damaged.

d:You take all your coins out of your pockets and show them to the blacksmith, who scrunches his nose thoughtfully and goes into the room behind the counter. You wait impatiently, watching his every move closely. After some time, the blacksmith brings out several variants of various swords and begins to examine them carefully. Your eyes tell you that you can't stand this tense moment and you wait impatiently for the blacksmith to choose your perfect sword.

d:A few minutes pass while the blacksmith chooses the best sword for you. You stand still with a plot in your hand and look with gentle eyes at the blacksmith who seems very serious and focused on his task. Finally, he settles on one sword, choosing it as the perfect match for you. The blacksmith offers it to you and says, "You can use this sword in any battle. It will be your finest ally on your path because it is so forceful and cutting." You take the sword out of his hands and notice how lightweight and easy to use it is. When you glance up at each other, you can tell that the blacksmith is proud of what he makes by himself.

d:You started shaking with anxiety as soon as you grabbed the sword from the blacksmith's hands. You made the decision that it would be wiser to steal this blade, so you immediately began to flee as far as you can. You turn around and dash back to the city's main gate, though, as you recall it. You make the decision to flee to the forest once more after realising that you won't be able to keep the sword and risk losing your freedom. Even though you are having trouble breathing because your heart is beating so quickly, you continue running because you want to leave the city as soon as possible. As soon as the crowns of trees begin to cover you, you stop and try to walk calmly without fearing anything.

You hide behind a tree and look in the direction of the voices. You see several people moving towards the clearing between the forest and the city, where the city guard might have seen you earlier. You get a little uneasy, but you continue to watch from a safe distance.

The trees, which had previously been immobile, abruptly started to move slowly. It soon became apparent that they are Ents, rather than regular trees. The guards began fighting the Ents because they were panicked and unsure of what to do. Trees sensed the danger and defended themselves, killing the guards with ease. The Ents then went back to their underground lairs, leaving you with a hazy memory of killed guards and an odd visual experience.

d:You were about to inquire with the blacksmith about the prospect of working in his shop when you decided against it because of your scant prior expertise. You said, "I'm seeking for a location where I can find myself as a person. I don't have much experience in blacksmithing, but I want to learn. Having said that, would you be willing to let me try working in your workshop?" The blacksmith gave you a long look before saying, "I can teach you the blacksmithing craft if you are prepared to put in the effort. But you'll have to put in a lot of effort and time. For it, are you prepared?" As soon as you declared yourself prepared, you got to work at the blacksmith's shop.

You knock on the door because there is nothing you can do, but no one answers. Regardless, you still choose to participate. You are impressed by the interior and atmosphere of the house. Every corner envelops you with its mysterious attraction. Admiring the space and furniture, you feel the atmosphere pressing in on you. You realize you're not the only person in the house when you suddenly hear footsteps. You are trying to find a place to hide when you see two people enter the corridor. One of them takes such a step that the shackles rattle can be heard. This man wears shackles on his hands and his head is also covered with some kind of cloth, while another man holds a chain. He is dressed very much and like a sorcerer. Your body tenses as your heart races as you try not to give away your location.

But you didn't feel anything and stood in a stupor for a while. Chucklin also didn't understand at first, but then he saw how the necklace was shining on your chest. You saw it too and touched the necklace with your hand. Then you noticed the mage's eyes full of terror and interest. After a few seconds of silence, the magician will speak first. He said he wants you to become his disciple. You agree and learn magic, you really liked magic and over a year you find out that your necklace is a magical artifact, which is a necklace, is a key element in the most powerful cult that controls the universe.
